Almost a year ago I [announced](http://writelesscode.com/blog/2014/04/25/end-of-netzke-development/) that I'm stopping with [Netzke](http://netzke.org). A few months later I was approached by someone from [PennyMac Load Services](http://www.pennymacusa.com), which appeared to be a [$346M company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PennyMac_Loan_Services) from the States, and they told me that they had a pretty massive app written with Netzke, and that they would like to contract me to help with further development. I honestly reminded them that Netzke was abandonware and suggested they look into other tools to build their app with. What I heard back was that they liked both Ext JS and Rails and would have to come up with something like Netzke anyway. A few emails later, we agreed that we'll start with a paid upgrade of Netzke to latest Rails and Ext JS.

And here it is.

Today I released [Netzke v0.12](https://rubygems.org/gems/netzke/versions/0.12.0) with support for Ext JS 5 and Rails 4.2 (for latest Rails and Ext JS 4.2 check out v0.11 released a few weeks before).

Along with that, I updated (and moved away from Heroku) the [official demo](http://demo.netzke.org) and [Yanit](http://yanit.netzke.org).

It feels good to be paid for open source. The next right thing would be the move toward v1.0, and I have the check list ready. Let's see how it comes out.
