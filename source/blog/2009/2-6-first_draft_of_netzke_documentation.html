<p>I finally found the time to scratch the itch and write a bit of documentation on Netzke. It’s just an introduction, but it will give one an idea about what can be done with Netzke and the design decisions lying behind. For now its location is simply the README file for the ‘netzke’ project on github (it’s rdoc-formatted by github), but as the file will grow, I’ll find a better location for it (maybe github’s wiki). See it here: <a href='http://github.com/nomadcoder/netzke/tree'>http://github.com/nomadcoder/netzke/tree</a></p>
