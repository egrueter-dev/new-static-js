In this tutorial we will build (from scratch) a composite component that will nest 2 grids (linked by a one-to-many relationship) and a form that will display some details about the record that is selected in one of the grids. I will show how easy it is to update all nested components within a single client-server roundtrip, using an approach which gives the developer a great level of freedom in building complex components. Live demo for this tutorial can be found [here](http://demo.netzke.org/basic_app#bossesAndClerksExt), while the code can be found in the [netzke-demo](http://github.com/netzke/netzke-demo) project (the rails3 branch) on GitHub.

> The rest of the tutorial is hosted on the Netzke wiki on GitHub. Please, help me keep it up-to-date by editing the wiki.
