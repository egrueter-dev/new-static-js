<p>I released a rubygem called ‘netzke-basepack’ which will progressively include several fully functional widgets that can be embedded into Rails’ views or can be used to build a desktop-like web-application. For now netzke-basepack only includes a Grid widget. It supports basic CRUD-operations, pagination, filters, one-to-many associations, moving/resizing columns, and basic configuration window (click the tool-button on the right-top of the grid) to dynamically configure the grid-columns and data-access rights.</p>

<p>The gem can be installed by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gem install netzke-basepack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and has a dependency on the netzke-core gem. See the README for basic instructions, and follow this blog for the soon-to-come tutorial on more advanced Grid features. A live demo may be announced here soon, too.</p>
