<img class="frame-right" src="http://writelesscode.com/images/2009-10-12.jpg" alt="ExtJS and Rails With Netzke. Custom Widget Actions."/>Today I'm posting a light-weight tutorial, which will show how to extend a Netzke component in order to add a custom [Ext.Action](http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.Action) into it, and then bind that to a new button in a toolbar, as well as to a new context menu item. Then you'll see how we can conditionally disable this action for more consistent end-user's experience. If Ext JS actions are still something new to you, you'll find this tutorial especially useful, as I'll provide a brief introduction unto them. Otherwise you'll see how easy it is to use Ext.Action with Netzke. As usual, there's an [online demo](http://netzke-demo.writelesscode.com/basic_app/demo#customActionsGrid) of this tutorial's results, and the source code is on [GitHub](http://github.com/netzke/netzke-demo/).

> I'm in the process of moving the tutorials on this blog over to the Netzke wiki on GitHub. Please, help me keep the material up-to-date by directly editing the wiki.
