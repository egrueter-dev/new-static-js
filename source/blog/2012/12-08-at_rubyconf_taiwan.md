excerpt: I spoke at RubyConf Taiwan this year, and, besides other nice folks, met the Japanese team that works on Ruby.

My talk went smoothly. For the first time I didn't use Keynote, made my presentation with [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff/) (you might need to use someone's fork though) - and thus, didn't have a usual opportunity to see presenter notes during the talk. Nor did I miss them. For the first time I felt very confident about my talk - also thanks to the feedback I got from [@hasclass](http://twitter.com/hasclass) just the night before. I [published the slides on Heroku](http://netzke-rubyconf-taiwan-2012.herokuapp.com) - you may want to page through them, they are pretty self-explanatory. As soon as I have access to the video, I'll post an update.

After the talk I came up to Matz (the creator of Ruby) and asked for his opinion. He started with his usual "Well, I'm not a web guy", and then continued: "But I like your concept. If I had to built a webapp like that, I would use your framework". A bit later, showing him the exact text, I asked him for a permission to quote him on [netzke.org](http://netzke.org), and he said "sure". I don't have to tell how excited I am about this. Other guys from the Ruby team seemed also quite [impressed](https://twitter.com/hsbt/status/277226452674568192), and recommended me to submit a proposal to [the rubykaigi](http://rubykaigi.org/2013) in May, with Matz saying "we need this kind of talks at RubyKaigi". Sure enough, I'll give it a try.

But for now, back to work on Netzke v0.8 - it's almost there!
