Recently I was invited to give a talk about Netzke at Ruby Open Air conference in Minsk. Before we get to my video, [Lee Humbley](http://twitter.com/codebeaker), the maintainer of Capistrano, who also spoke at the event, made a very nice (and honest) [write-up](http://lee.hambley.name/blog/2012/06/18/altoros-ruby-open-air-belarus.html) reflecting his impressions of the conference and Belarus as a country - check it out!

I guess, I managed to come up with a reasonable introduction to what kind of problems Netzke is supposed to solve (the slides are [here](http://www.slideshare.net/netzke/modular-web-applications-with-netzke)). Please, feel free to leave here your comments on it.
