excerpt: I got to the final round of EuRuKo speaker selection, and now would appreciate you taking the last little action to help me get selected
---
With your support, I was honored to get to the list of EuRuKo speaker selection finalists. I'll admit I got a bit pessimistic about my chances first, as I'm standing on the very last place [on the list](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals). However, today I got a very encouraging email from a Taiwanese friend who saw me speaking about Netzke at RubyConf Taiwan last year. He wrote me that himself, as well as a few colleagues of his who also were at the conference, have voted for my proposal in the final round, and are wishing me luck. Motivated by this, I decided that it may be worth trying to push it one more last time, so, I'm asking you again to spend 1 minute of your time to login with your GitHub account [here](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals), and drag-and-drop my proposal (search for "Netzke") to the "Your selection" area, along with 9 other proposals. And if you could motivate one or two of your colleagues to do the same - that'd be extra-awesome!

The voting ends in 3 days. Can't express how much I appreciate your support!
