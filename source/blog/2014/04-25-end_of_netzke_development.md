excerpt: I find no more satisfaction in pushing Netzke forward

I'm stopping with Netzke development. A couple more 0.10.x releases are still probable, as I am to finish a client's app with this version, but you shouldn't count on Ext JS 5 or Rails 4.1 support in the future. After a few years working on Netzke I have to admit (rather unwillingly) that it was too ambitious a project for me, which gradually turned from good fun into burden. So, I felt an urge to free that space for something fresh. I warmly thank all [the](https://github.com/netzke/netzke-core/graphs/contributors) [contributors](https://github.com/netzke/netzke-basepack/graphs/contributors) and supporters.

If you feel you're a right person to become the new Netzke maintainer - I'll be happy to hear from you.

This blog will probably be turned into a more generic coding- and productivity-related one, similar to my [tweets](https://twitter.com/mxgrn).
